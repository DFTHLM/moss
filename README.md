# moss - my os (that) sucks
A simple kernel with a start of a basic tty. Backsapce and enter works, currently working on a simple cursor.
My goal is to poke around and learn how things work on the most basic scale
Run with:
```make
make run
```
Requirements:
+ gcc, ld, nasm to compile
+ qemu x86_64 to run
